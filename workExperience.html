                <p>Project: <strong>Supervised Learning Methods for Image Recognition</strong></p>
                <p>Self-supervised learning is a recent paradigm that is becoming increasingly popular for learning recognition models without the need for annotations. 
                    In this project, the aim is to explore the benchmark methods used in self- supervision and apply these to image recognition problems. 
                    At the end of the project, I will get familiar with the recent self-supervised learning techniques used for image recognition.</p>

                <p id="date">June 2021 - October 2021</p>
                <p>For the first project, built an <strong>OCR</strong> system that reads the given images of scoreboards using <strong>Python</strong>. 
                    After coding phase ended, wrote unit tests using <strong>pytest</strong>. Also used <strong>pylint</strong> for coding standards.</p>
                <p>For the first project, worked with a foreign student teammate. For the both project, worked under the supervision of my supervisors.</p>
                <p>For the second project, built a <strong>machine learning</strong> system for surface anomaly detection <strong>from beginning to end</strong>. 
                    First, made <strong>data preprocessing</strong> like splitting to train ‑ test, batching and resizing. 
                    Then, wrote <strong>cnn</strong>, <strong>svm</strong> using <strong>sklearn</strong>, <strong>cnn+svm</strong> mixed model and 
                    <strong>pretrained inception</strong> models using <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong>. 
                    After that, made <strong>model deployment</strong> using <strong>FastAPI</strong>. Finally, set up a <strong>pipeline</strong> system.</p>
